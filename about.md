My name is Zach, and I am equal parts scientist, hacker, writer, and joker (note: equality only in the large-N limit; local deviations from the average are bound to happen).


## Where I've Been

+ Born in _beautiful_ South Dakota, home to the world's only [corn palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Palace)
+ Educated at [the University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu) (Go Irish!) and [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu) (Go Big Red, except in instances of conflict with the Irish, in which case don't go, but rather stay!)
+ Married in Pittsburgh, PA (Go Caitlin!)


## Where I Am

I work for Achievement Asset Management, a hedge fund in Chicago, IL. I work with great people on interesting projects in the financial world, and learn something new every day.


## The Fine Print

I am a passionate and resourceful problem solver with analytical acumen and experience in high-performance, rapid-response environments. My favorite thing to do is play with a new, fun concept -- to apply my analytic, strategic, and computational skills to develop robust, useful, and creative software. My primary skills are:

+ Creative, flexible, and rapid problem analysis and response
+ An ability to learn anything, proficiently and quickly.
+ A no-nonsense, can-do attitude toward group problem solving
+ Excellent interpersonal skills
+ A driven, independent work ethic

### Contact me

Drop me a line at [r.zach.lamberty@gmail.com](mailto:r.zach.lamberty@gmail.com). If you haven't heard back from me immediately, it's because I'm writing a missive, and it will be funny.

In my opinion, at least.
