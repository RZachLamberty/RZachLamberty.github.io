Being a cheapskate, when I set up my AWS instances I went for the free tier. Being a l33tskate, I also created a ``postgres`` database that I intended to slam a couple of gigs of WMATA train location information into. Here I am, about a month later, with a couple million records in my ``postgres`` database and 92% disk usage. Time to pay the [iron price](https://youtu.be/D-OnuOC2yQ8).

The [AWS documentation on how to do this](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html) is super helpful, actually. I followed it exactly. The only bummer in it is that the super awesome unicorn solution -- that I could do this automatically on the fly -- doesn't seem to be an option. Still, even if I knew nothing about what I was doing instead of the epsilon I do know, I could have folowed this walkthrough and accomplished what I wanted to accomplish.

The same cannot be said for billing. We'll see how much this will cost come the end of the month, because right now I would estimate it's somewhere between $0.00 and $infinity.
