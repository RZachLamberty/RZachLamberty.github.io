## Profile
I am a passionate and resourceful problem solver with analytical acumen and experience in high-performance, rapid-response environments. I am looking for the opportunity to apply my analytic, strategic, and computational skills to fast-paced, real-world problems by developing robust, useful, and creative applications. My primary skills are:  
+ Creative, flexible, and rapid problem analysis and response
+ An ability to learn anything, proficiently and quickly.
+ A no-nonsense, can-do attitude toward group problem solving
+ Excellent interpersonal and communication skills
+ A driven, independent work ethic

## Primary Professional Experience
**Software Developer**, Achievement Asset Management (N&eacute;e Peak6 Investments), Chicago, IL, Sep. 2013 - present
+ Extensive real-world experience developing in the Python programming language
+ Went from having no finance or real-world dev experience to being a trusted source of information on myriad topics in the day-to-day operation of a highly successful hedge fund by asking thoughtful questions, actively participating in discussions, conferences, and training, and researching independently;
+ Have been described by managers and coworkers as having "great attention to detail," a "genuine interest", and being "reliable," "an excellent learner," "responsible," a "future leader," and "our favorite dev to work with;"
+ Researched, tested, installed, and configured a highly successful, reliable open source job-scheduling and management software system (SOS Open Source Job Scheduler);
+ Developed flexible, resilient, and reliable software directly responsible for crucial business operations;
+ Cultivated mentorship relationships with senior devs on my team by arranging recurring discussions about best practices and sought feedback on areas for growth and improvement;
+ Honed developer and "dev-ops" skills in a high-stakes environment;
+ Generated positive work relationships with demanding clients in difficult and contentious environments;
+ Migrated a multi-year file transfer and clearing process into a sleeker, more reliable process in under two weeks;
+ Stepped up abd assisted in systems administration and dev-ops roles when the need arose by learning and implementing monitoring software (aforementioned job scheduler, Zenoss and Zenoss task integration, PagerDuty) and proactively volunteering my help at all times;
+ In one year, became the only dev in the organization to understand and develop for all of our systems from installation to standard use cases, and am primarily responsible for half of them.

## Skills and Strengths
### Software Development
+ Continually sought to expand my proficiency in the Python programming language
+ Focused on increasing knowledge of DevOps monitoring practices and collaborative tech team workflow processes by consulting with teammates and mentors on best practices
+ Experienced myriad of development environments (e.g., multiple operating systems, multiple languages, open source vs. proprietary code, vendor vs. in-house software, long-term vs. high-urgency devlopment)
+ Independently learned the R programming language and related software packages (e.g., RShiny), advocated for and successfully applied them in the business setting
+ Am extremely flexibile when it comes to languages, best practices, and institutional preferences -- "use the best tool, not 'your' tool"
+ Completely and succinctly documented code with a primary emphasis on supportability by other developers
+ Excellence in the Python programming language, and proficiency in the C, C++, R, SQL, FORTRAN, Mathematic, Matlab, Octave, (La)Tex, and PowerShell programming languages. Experience in Java, JavaScript, HTML5. Mastery of development and monitoring tools Git, GitHub, SOS Open Source Job Scheduler, Zenoss, Graylog, emacs, CodeBlocks IDE, and JIRA. Experience with multiple finance-specific software packages (Paladyne OMS, Geneva Accounting Software, FrontArena Risk
Management, OpenStaars Reconciliation Tool). Have used multiple serialization and message protocols (Google protocol buffers, xml, html, json, etc).

### Analysis
+ Independently developed business usage reporting to make successful recommendations on license purchasing and usage
+ Approached multi-institution processes (reporting, clearing, and file transfer among multiple vendors), identified the key technical requirements, and created a highly reliable framework meeting all business needs
+ Designed and constructed advanced computer simulations (involving state-of-the-art classical and quantum Monte Carlo techniques) to study physical systems
+ Wrote efficient, well-documented, and object-oriented code in Python, C++, and FORTRAN
+ Maintained and data-mined large-scale computational simulations over the course of four years
+ Performed quantitative and qualitative analysis of large data sets using Python and SciPy; developed methods for extracting meaningful correlations and relationships for scientific publication
+ Analyzed and critiqued the work of professional scientists and discussed my analysis with fellow research scientists
+ Designed and implemented a strategic long-term plan for answering advanced scientific research questions in the field of highly frustrated magnets

### Problem Solving
+ Developed a novel family of models to analyze unsolved and intractable physical phenomena
+ Learned several programming languages and tools (Python, C/C++, FORTRAN, Git, Mathematica, Google's Protocol Buffers, OpenGL) independently to solve problems and advance analysis capabilities
+ Posed an advanced scientific question, produced results, and published those results
+ Learned and implemented computational methods which allowed for effective calculations of research problems too computationally difficult for traditional methods

### Communication
+ Cultivated positive, friendly, and professional relationships with everyone with whom I've worked
+ Effectively communicated ideas concisely and completely in high-stress environments
+ Established professional relationships with developers and vendors at professional conferences
+ Published one scientific article in Physical Review Letters, and submitted a second for review
+ Presented research results at the 2012 American Physical Society March Meeting and the 2010 and 2012 Highly Frustrated Magnetism conferences both to large audiences and in one-on-one settings
+ Advocated for STEM research and education funding to congressional delegations on behalf of the American Physical Society at the 20011 and 2012 Science-Engineering-Technology Congressional Visit Days
+ Designed, managed, and taught sections for four Cornell University science courses, three of which were aimed at non-scientist audiences

### Leadership and Collaboration
+ Worked in highly-collaborative five- and six-person teams of developers at Peak6.
+ Successfuly lead tech team projects (such as a long-term reconciliation revamping for total return swap processing) by clearly communicating expectations and constantly following up about tech team progress and business satisfaction and desires.
+ Mediated interpersonal conflict as assistant rector at Notre Dame by facilitating conversations and diffusing emotional situations
+ Served as Vice President, President, and Chief Advisor of the Physics Graduate Society and acted as liaison to the graduate school and department faculty and management to determine issues such as organizational funding and policies towards students
+ Completed the one-week "Leadership Assessment for Managers" course at Cornell University
+ Mentored eight prospective graduate students and five enrolled graduate students, as well as two undergraduate researchers
+ Initiated mutually-enriching collaborations with other professional researchers
+ Organized an annual outreach booth at the Ithaca Festival and oversaw the transition of its management
+ Arranged weekly graduate student science seminars and recruited graduate student participants
+ Repaired a weakness in the physics graduate student curriculum by creating a for-credit summer reading course

### Other Activities
+ Ithaca Big Brothers Big Sisters volunteer
+ American Physical Society member
+ Cornell Intramural Flag Football Champion
