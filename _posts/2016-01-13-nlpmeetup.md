Tonight I (finally!) made it to my first DC meetup event, and it was that of the [DC NLP meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DC-NLP/). There was a good crowd there to see [Brian Sacash](https://github.com/bsacash) present the *sentiment analysis* section of his Udemy course.

The presentation included a (well-done) live demo of the [`nltk`](http://www.nltk.org/) package, but personally I found the material a little too much on the intro side for me. I would be interested in messing around with `nltk` in the future based on what I saw, but I'm not fixing to run out and crank out my own project based on what I learned tonight.

I would recommend both the videos and the level of the udacity course for beginners and absolute beginners. Check out the full course material on [bsacash's github site](https://github.com/bsacash/Introduction-to-NLP)
