# Hello!

Hello, and welcome to my github user page. You're probably better off heading [here](http://rzachlamberty.github.io/), but if you really feel the need to get into the nitty gritty of it, have at it my friend.

Special thanks to [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) for [his excellent review](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) on how to get up and running with github user pages and Jekyll

## Development

Just a heads up (mostly for myself): if you want to test this locally, rely on [this walkthrough](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) of how to do that. Most important command:

``` bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
