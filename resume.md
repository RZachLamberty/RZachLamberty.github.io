## Profile
I am a passionate and resourceful problem solver and data hacker with analytical acumen and experience in high-performance, rapid-response environments. I am looking for the opportunity to apply my analytic, strategic, and programmatic skills to fast-paced, real-world problems by developing fascinating, robust, and creative applications. My primary skills are:  

+ Creative, flexible, and rapid problem analysis and response
+ An ability to learn anything, proficiently and quickly.
+ A knack for to-the-point communication
+ A no-nonsense, can-do attitude toward group problem solving
+ Excellent interpersonal and communication skills
+ A driven, independent work ethic

## Primary Professional Experience
**Software Developer**, Achievement Asset Management (N&eacute;e Peak6 Investments), Chicago, IL, Sep. 2013 - present

+ Extensive real-world experience developing in the Python programming language
+ Went from having no finance or real-world dev experience to being a trusted source of information on myriad topics in the day-to-day operation of a successful hedge fund by asking thoughtful questions, diving into our codebase, actively participating in discussions, conferences, and training, and researching independently;
+ Have been described by managers and coworkers as having "great attention to detail," a "genuine interest", and being "reliable," "an excellent learner," "responsible," a "future leader," and "our favorite dev to work with;"
+ Developed flexible, resilient, and reliable software directly responsible for crucial client-facing business operations;
+ Assisted in the planning and execution of our central data warehouse by researching possibilities, mocking up best options, developing prototypes and implementation plans, and executing those plans;
+ Researched, tested, installed, and configured a highly successful, reliable open source job-scheduling and management software system (SOS Open Source Job Scheduler);
+ Cultivated mentorship relationships with senior devs on my team by arranging recurring discussions about best practices and sought feedback on areas for growth and improvement;
+ Honed developer and "dev-ops" skills in a high-stakes environment;
+ Generated positive work relationships with demanding clients in difficult and contentious environments;
+ Migrated a multi-year file transfer and clearing process into a sleeker, more reliable process in under two weeks;
+ Stepped up and assisted in systems administration and dev-ops roles when the need arose by learning and implementing monitoring software (aforementioned job scheduler, Zenoss and Zenoss task integration, PagerDuty) and proactively volunteering my help at all times;
+ In one year, became the only dev in the organization to understand and develop for all of our systems from installation to standard use cases, and am primarily responsible for three quarters of them

+ Single-handedly Designed and implemented an end-to-end ETL library for acquisition, cleaning, and storage of sensitive reconciliation data;
+ Independently researched the principles of financial risk analysis and implemented an open source alternative to the currently-used proprietary system;
+ Maintained and data-mined large-scale computational physics simulations over the course of four years;
+ Performed quantitative and qualitative analysis of large data sets using the scientific Python stack, and developed methods for extracting meaningful correlations and relationships for scientific publication;
+ Wrote efficient, well-documented, and object-oriented code in Python, C++, and FORTRAN;
+ Analyzed and critiqued the work of professional scientists and discussed my analysis with fellow research scientists;
+ Designed and implemented a strategic long-term plan for answering advanced scientific research questions in the field of highly frustrated magnets;
+ Independently developed business usage reporting to make successful recommendations on license purchasing and usage;
+ Approached multi-institution processes (reporting, clearing, and file transfer among multiple vendors), identified the key technical requirements, and created a highly reliable framework meeting all business needs;
+ Completed several Coursera tracks on data science and analytics

### Software Development

+ Continually sought to expand my proficiency in the Python programming language;
+ Focused on increasing knowledge of DevOps monitoring practices and collaborative tech team workflow processes by consulting with teammates and mentors on best practices;
+ Independently learned the R programming language and related content distribution packages (e.g., RShiny), advocated for and successfully applied them in the business setting
+ Experienced myriad of development environments (e.g., team-based vs independent; multiple operating systems, physical/virtual architetures, and languages; open source vs. proprietary code; vendor vs. in-house software; long-term vs. high-urgency devlopment);
+ Am extremely flexibile when it comes to languages, best practices, and institutional preferences -- "use the best tool, not 'your' tool"
+ Completely and succinctly documented code with a primary emphasis on supportability by other developers;
