## Profile
I am a passionate and resourceful problem solver and data hacker with analytical acumen and experience in high-performance, rapid-response environments. *I want to build meaningful, useful applications*. My primary skills are:  

+ Creative, flexible, and rapid problem analysis
+ An ability to learn anything, proficiently and quickly.
+ A knack for to-the-point communication
+ A driven, independent work ethic

## Primary Professional Experience
**Software Developer**, Achievement Asset Management (N&eacute;e Peak6 Investments), Chicago, IL, Sep. 2013 - present

+ Extensive real-world experience developing in the Python programming language
+ Went from having no finance or real-world dev experience to being a trusted source of information on myriad topics in the day-to-day operation of a successful hedge fund by asking thoughtful questions, diving into our codebase, actively participating in discussions, conferences, and training, and researching independently;
+ Have been described by managers and coworkers as having "great attention to detail," a "genuine interest", and being "reliable," "an excellent learner," "responsible," a "future leader," and "our favorite dev to work with;"
+ Assisted in the planning and execution of our central data warehouse by researching possibilities, mocking up best options, developing prototypes and implementation plans, and executing those plans;
+ Replaced file transfer and clearing process into a sleeker, more reliable process in under two weeks;
+ In one year, became the only dev in the organization to understand and develop for all of our systems from installation to standard use cases, and am primarily responsible for three quarters of them

## Skills and Strengths
### Analysis

+ Designed and constructed advanced computer simulations (involving state-of-the-art classical and quantum Monte Carlo techniques) to study physical systems;
+ Designed and implemented an end-to-end ETL library for acquisition, cleaning, and storage of sensitive reconciliation data;
+ Maintained and data-mined large-scale computational physics simulations over the course of four years;
+ Performed quantitative and qualitative analysis of large data sets using the scientific Python stack, and developed methods for extracting meaningful correlations and relationships for scientific publication;
+ Wrote efficient, well-documented, and object-oriented code in Python, C++, and FORTRAN;
+ Analyzed and critiqued the work of professional scientists and discussed my analysis with fellow research scientists;
+ Designed a multi-year strategic plan for answering scientific research questions in the field of highly frustrated magnets;
+ Independently developed business usage reporting to make successful recommendations on license purchasing and usage;
+ Approached multi-institution processes (reporting, clearing, and file transfer among multiple vendors), identified the key technical requirements, and created a highly reliable framework meeting all business needs;
+ Completed several Coursera tracks on data science and analytics

### Problem Solving

+ Developed a novel family of models to analyze unsolved and intractable physical phenomena;
+ Reduced several hundred lines of custom in-house Python code with one bash script and the right ftp client (lftp); 
+ Learned several programming languages and tools (Python, C/C++, FORTRAN, Git, Mathematica, Google's Protocol Buffers, OpenGL) independently to solve problems and advance analysis capabilities;
+ Posed an advanced scientific question, produced results, and published those results;
+ Learned and implemented computational methods which allowed for effective calculations of research problems too computationally difficult for traditional methods

### Software Development

+ Continually sought to expand my proficiency in the Python programming language;
+ Focused on increasing knowledge of DevOps monitoring practices and collaborative tech team workflow processes by consulting with teammates and mentors on best practices;
+ Independently learned the R programming language and related content distribution packages (e.g., RShiny), advocated for and successfully applied them in the business setting
+ Experienced myriad of development environments (e.g., team-based vs independent; multiple operating systems, physical/virtual architetures, and languages; open source vs. proprietary code; vendor vs. in-house software; long-term vs. high-urgency devlopment);
+ Demonstrated extreme flexibility when it comes to languages, best practices, and institutional preferences -- "use the best tool, not 'your' tool"
+ Completely and succinctly documented code with a primary emphasis on supportability by other developers;

### Programming Experience
+ **programming and scripting languages**: excellence in python<sup>[1](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/cta)+[ipynb](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/cta/blob/master/cta_demo.ipynb),[2](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/dc_apt_listings),[3](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/Magic)+[ipynb](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/Magic/blob/master/magic_mana_demo.ipynb),[4](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/FantasyFootball),[5](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/FootballStats),[6](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/WorkCommute)</sup> and bash<sup>[1](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/nursing_home_data_collection),[2](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/zshell)</sup>; proficiency in R<sup>[1](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/getdata_course_project)</sup>, C, C++, (Postgre)SQL, and xpath; and experience with C#, Java,Ruby/Rails, FORTRAN, Matlab, Octave, Mathematica, (La)Tex, markdown, sweave, PowerShell, Julia, JavaScript, CSS, html, OpenGL;
