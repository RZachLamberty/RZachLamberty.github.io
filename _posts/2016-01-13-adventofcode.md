If you enjoy puzzles &mdash; especially programming puzzles &mdash; you simply have to check out [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)'s super-nutso-awesome [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) site. Create an account and go to town. Do it.

I'll admit, it was probably more fun back when you could still get on the leaderboard; but you can still shoot for the time. And if you're interested, check out [my python solutions](https://github.com/RZachLamberty/adventofcode).
